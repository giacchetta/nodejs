# **Wanderlust**

Using `fetch`, `async`, and `await`, you’ll request information from the [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/) and [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/current) to create a travel website.

Before you begin, you’ll need to register for developer accounts for both of the APIs above. They’re both free.

For Foursquare, once you make an account, [create a new app](https://foursquare.com/developers/register) and fill out the form (you can put any link in the “App or Company URL” field). The Foursquare API will then give you a client ID and a client secret. You’ll need to save both of those in  **main.js** .

For OpenWeather, follow the instructions for the [I. Registration process: How to start](https://openweathermap.org/guide/#how). When prompted, use your first name, and `other` for the OpenWeather questions for their data collection. OpenWeather will give you an API Key, which you’ll also need to save in  **main.js** .

You can view [a live version of this project here](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/intermediate-javascript-requests/wanderlust/wanderlust-v3/index.html).

## Tasks

**1.**

Save the client ID you obtained from the Foursquare API to `const clientId`.

**2.**

Save the client secret you obtained from the Foursquare API to `const clientSecret`.

**3.**

Create a `const` called `url`. Check [the Foursquare documentation](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/venues/explore) to see the `explore venue` API endpoint.

Add the `near` parameter without a value. To add a query to the end of a URL, be sure to use `?` followed by the first key (`near`) and an `=`. You’ll add the value of the `near` parameter to this URL string when you make the request itself.

**4.**

Save the API Key you obtained from OpenWeather to `const openWeatherKey`.

**5.**

Create a `const` called `weatherUrl`, save `'https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather'` as the value.

See examples of OpenWeather API calls under ‘Examples of API calls’ on [the OpenWeather documentation](https://openweathermap.org/current).

## Get Data from Foursquare

**6.**

The following steps will guide you through constructing the `getVenues()` function which is called from `executeSearch()`.

Turn `getVenues()` into an asynchronous function that returns a Promise.

**7.**

Inside of that function, add a `const` called `city`. Save the value from the user’s input field on the page with `$input.val()`.

Stuck? Get a hint

**8.**

Add a `const` called `urlToFetch`. This string will contain the combined text of the entire request URL

* the API endpoint URL
* the user’s input city
* a `limit` parameter with the number of venues you wish to return (use `10`)
* the `client_id` parameter and your client ID
* the `client_secret` parameter and your client secret
* the `v` (version) parameter and today’s date in this format: `YYYYMMDD`

Each key-value parameter pair should be joined to the others with `&`. For instance, to request 5 venues with a client ID of `1234`, that portion of the URL would be `limit=5&client_id=1234`.

**9.**

Add `try`/`catch` statements with empty code blocks.

**10.**

In the `catch` code block, log the `error` to the console.

Stuck? Get a hint

**11.**

In the `try` code block, use `fetch()` to send a `GET` request to `urlToFetch`. `await` the response and save it to a variable called `response` using the `const` keyword.

Stuck? Get a hint

**12.**

Create a conditional statement that checks if the `ok` property of the `response` object evaluates to a truthy value.

Stuck? Get a hint

**13.**

Log the `response` to the console. In the browser window with the Wanderlust page, enter a city in the search field and submit. Make sure that you have your own browser’s JavaScript console open so that you can see the response that is logged to the console.

**14.**

Notice that the response includes the URL you requested but doesn’t include the information you asked for. Copy and paste the URL into a new tab in your browser. It might be difficult to read, so try using an extension such as [JSON View](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonview/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc?hl=en) to parse the data. If you don’t want to use an extension, you can also try [JSBeautifier](http://jsbeautifier.org/). Examine the object.

**15.**

Convert the response object to a `JSON` object. `await` the resolution of this method and save it to a variable called `jsonResponse` using the `const` keyword.

Log `jsonResponse` to the [console](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-javascript-developer-console).

Stuck? Get a hint

**16.**

Explore the object in the console. There’s a lot of information in there. Let’s save some of that data to a variable called `venues`. Specifically, follow this nesting chain from the `jsonResponse` variable to get an array of venue data:

* the `response` property (an object)
* the `groups` property (an array)
* the first element of `groups`
* the `items` property (an array of venue data)

Stuck? Get a hint

**17.**

Log `venues` to the console and see what the API sent back. There should be an array with the number of objects you selected in the `limit` parameter. You’ll *only* want the `venue` property inside of these objects. Use `.map()` to save these `venues` to the `venues` array from the previous step.

Add `.map(parameter => parameter.valueToStore)` to the end of the code from the previous step.

Stuck? Get a hint

**18.**

Return `venues` as the very last line of the `try` code block. Open the hint to peek at the whole `try` block.

**19.**

Run the code and see what is logged to the console now!

## Get Data from OpenWeather

**20.**

The following steps will guide you through constructing the `getForecast()` function which is called from `executeSearch()`.

Turn `getForecast()` into an asynchronous function that returns a Promise. Add empty `try`/`catch` blocks inside. Log the error inside the `catch` block.

Stuck? Get a hint

**21.**

Before the `try` code block, create a `const` called `urlToFetch` that includes:

* the base `weatherUrl`
* the `q` parameter (representing the location query) with a value of the user’s input (`$input.val()`)
* and your API key as the `APPID` parameter

Don’t forget to join parameter key-value pairs after the API key with `&`.

Stuck? Get a hint

**22.**

Inside of the `try` block, `await` the response of calling `fetch()` and passing it the URL you created in a previous step. Save the response to a variable called `response` using the `const` keyword.

Stuck? Get a hint

**23.**

Create a conditional statement that checks the `ok` property of the `response` object. If this evaluates to a truthy value, await the response of calling `.json()` on the `response` object. Save the resolution of this Promise to a variable called `jsonResponse` using the `const` keyword.

Stuck? Get a hint

**24.**

Log `jsonResponse` to the console. Enter a city in the browser and see what is logged! Explore the object!

**25.**

Return `jsonResponse` at the bottom of the `try` code block. Open the hint to inspect the complete `try` block inside `getForecast()`.

## Render Data From Foursquare API

**26.**

If you want to follow the steps and render the data with guidance, that’s great! If not, check the hint and update the `renderVenues()` function provided in  **main.js** .

Stuck? Get a hint

**27.**

In  **main.js** . There’s a function called `renderVenues` that calls the `.forEach()` method on the `$venueDivs` array. This is an array of the `<div>`s in **index.html** where you will render the information returned in the response from the Foursquare API.

Towards the bottom of this method, there is a variable called `venueContent`. It’s an empty string for now, but you’ll be replacing it with an HTML string to render correct venue information.

Start by creating a `const` `venue` to represent the individual venue object inside of the `.forEach()` callback. Save the current venue at `venues[index]` to this variable.

Stuck? Get a hint

**28.**

Create a `venueIcon` `const` to save the value of the object representing the venue icon. This is accessible as the `icon` property of the first element in the array of `categories` of the `venue` object.

Stuck? Get a hint

**29.**

Now, construct the full source URL for the venue icon. The `venueIcon` has a `prefix` and `suffix` field used to construct a source path. You can inspect more information about the icon object in the Response Fields and sample Response in the [Foursquare documentation](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/api/venues/categories) or log `venueIcon` to the console to inspect it.

Concatenate or combine the `prefix` property of `venueIcon`, the string `'bg_64'`, and the suffix, and save to a `const` `venueImgSrc`. `'bg_64'` is required to fetch icons with a gray background that will show up against the background of the Wanderlust page.

**30.**

Now construct the HTML string to add the new venue. You can use your knowledge of the `venue` object shape and [this HTML template](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/intermediate-javascript-requests/wanderlust/wanderlust%20templates/venueHTMLTemplate.txt) or follow the steps below. Open the hint for more information about implementing from the HTML template.

Stuck? Get a hint

**31.**

A helper function named `createVenueHTML()` has been provided to construct the HTML string to display the venue information. You can examine it in  **public/helpers.js** , and it is linked in **index.html** so that you can use it in  **main.js** .

Pass `createVenueHTML()` the venue’s name, location, and image source URL and save the returned string to the `venueContent` variable.

Stuck? Get a hint

**32.**

Now it’s time to hook up your `renderVenues()` function to the data fetched by `getVenues()`.

In the `executeSearch()` function towards the bottom of  **main.js** , `getVenues()` and `getForecast()` are already being called.

Chain a `.then()` method to `getVenues()`. `.then()`‘s callback function should take a single parameter, `venues`, and return `renderVenues(venues)`.

Save your code, search for a location, and you should be able to see venue information displayed towards the bottom of the Wanderlust page!

**34.**

Now construct the HTML string to add the weather forecast in the `renderForecast` function. When it’s called, the `jsonResponse` returned from calling `getForecast()` will be passed in as `day`. You can inspect the `day` object’s shape and this [HTML template](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/intermediate-javascript-requests/wanderlust/wanderlust%20templates/forecastHTMLTemplate.txt) or follow the steps below. Open the hint for more information about implementing from the HTML template.

**35.**

A helper function named `createWeatherHTML()` has been provided to construct the HTML string to display the weather information. You can examine it in  **public/helpers.js** , and it is linked in **index.html** so that you can use it in  **main.js** .

Pass `createWeatherHTML()` the `day` and save the returned string to the `weatherContent` variable.

Stuck? Get a hint

**36.**

Time to hook up the forecast data and the render function.

Inside `executeSearch()`, add a `.then()` method to `getForecast()`. `.then()`‘s callback function should take a single parameter, `forecast`, and return `renderForecast(forecast)`.

## Complete!

**37.**

Congratulations! You should now be able to search for venue and weather details by city and see the response on the page!

**Note:** The OpenWeather API endpoint we use can take input of the form: `city, state`, like `Baltimore, Maryland`. You can read more about the OpenWeather API [here](https://openweathermap.org/current).

## Challenges

**38.**

Try out any of the challenges below to get more practice!

**39.**

Fetch more than 4 venues and randomize which ones are added to the page.

**40.**

Include additional information about the weather.

**41.**

Include additional information about each venue from the response.

For a real challenge, try fetching venue photos! This will require an additional request for [venue details](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/api/venues/details) for each venue, as the photo information is not returned in the initial request.
